<h1>
  Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ <br> 
  my name is Alex, <br> 
  web developer, teacher & former-lawyer ðŸ¤“ 
</h1>

### A little on myself

<p>
  âŒ› I currently teach web development and build standards-based web apps and demos
  <br>
  ðŸŽ¯ I love JS & my main library I work with is React.js (and meta React frameworks)
  <br>
   ðŸŒ± I'm adding other JS frameworks to my belt, but slowly diving deeper into Rust and data-science
  <br>
  ðŸ§© Outisde of dev work, I love listening to legal podcasts, tinkering with my SuperCoach side, skiing, cycling & helping others begin their dev journeys!
